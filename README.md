remarks about sum-even

1. In this question, I created a bit-mask to detect even numbers through TEST instruction
2. Those numbers that turned out to be even, I added them into a sum variable.
3. And, those which were not, they were not added.
4. I also counted the number of even values in the array.
5. At the end, I displayed the Sum and the number of even numbers appeared.

remarks about sum-odd

1. In this question, I created a bit-mask to detect odd numbers through TEST instruction
2. Those numbers that turned out to be odd, I added them into a sum variable.
3. And, those which were not, they were not added.
4. I also counted the number of odd values in the array.
5. At the end, I displayed the Sum and the number of even numbers.

remarks about sum-pos

1. In this question, I created a bit-mask to detect positive numbers through TEST instruction
2. Those numbers that turned out to be positive, I added them into a sum variable.
3. And the negative numbers skipped addition.
4. I also counted the number of positive values in the array.
5. At the end, I displayed the Sum and the number of positive numbers.


Overall remarks

Different operations were applied on the array to obtain no. of results and observations.
